[1] test_football.m
URL: http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/schedules/FBS/week1 
 
The URL contains the schedules for NCAA FBS college football teams. 
College football teams form conferences, and intra-conference games are 
played more frequently than inter-conference games.

Therefore, the groups of teams that form conferences corresponds to 
natural clusters.

INPUT FILES: 
------------
play_graph.txt - Contains edges between nodes in graph. Extracted from
                 dataset. Format: Source_node Target_node
inverse_teams.txt - Contains team names for each node. Serves as labels. 
                    Extracted from dataset. Format: Node_Id Team_Name
OUTPUT FILES:
-------------
nodes.csv      - Contains node no. and cluster id to which node belongs 
edges.csv      - Edges between nodes in the graph
norm_nodes.csv - Same as nodes.csv for normalized version
norm_edges.csv - Same as edges.csv for normalized version

The following url provides actual groups/conference structure:
http://espn.go.com/college-football/teams
It could be used as ground truth to verify the clusters.

[2] test_citationgraph.m

A citation graph containing information about the citations of papers.  
It is expected that papers linked by citation form good clusters.  %

INPUT FILES:
------------
citation_graph.txt - Contains edges between nodes in graph. Nodes are 
                     papers. If there is an edge, the source was cited 
                     by target. 
                     Format: Source_node Target_node
title_inverse.txt - Contains paper names for each node. Serves as labels. 
                    Extracted from dataset. Format: Node_Id Paper_Name
OUTPUT FILES:
-------------
clusters.txt      - Contains cluster id and all the papers belonging to
                    that cluster.

Generated by the program. Data points are clustered into two circles -
inner and outer ring using coordinate system.
